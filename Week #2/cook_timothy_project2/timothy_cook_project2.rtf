After adding jQuery. I still need to get a lot done and will get that to you saturday. I know all that I need to do, I just ran out of time. I spent so much time trying to get my javascript to add jquery instead of ul and li tags. But every time I come up with nothing. I will try my best to get this done once I get home to faster internet tomorrow. \
